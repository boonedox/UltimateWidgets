This project is based on the sample php project provided by Heroku.  As such, it is ready to deploy to a Heroku instance.

You will need to provide two environment variables in order for the app to work.

WEATHER_API_KEY - used to fetch weather data from wunderground
EXCEL_FILE_URL - used to fetch spreadsheet for attendee data.

The weather app should be fairly re-usable.

The attendees app is currently very specific to my needs.
